# Structural-Prediction
Eye tracking studies of linguistic-structure-driven prediction in children

This set of studies will examine whether children's predictive eye movements about upcoming words are driven by simple semantic priming, or instead are generated based on the linguistic structure heard so far. To do this, we build on a method developed by Kukona et al (2011, Cognition). In their study participants heard sentences whose verb either is or is not stereotypically associated with both an agent and patient. e.g., the verb 'arrest' is associated with policeman and robber (in British English), while the verb 'meet' does not have stereotypical agents and patients. In the sentences, the agent is replaced with a named character e.g., 'John will arrest the robber'. However, both the stereotypical agent and patient are displayed in the visual scene. Kukona et al. found enhanced looks to both agent and patient pictures after the verb but before the critical noun. There were, however, more looks to the patient, suggesting that adults' eye movements were driven by both priming and expectations about forthcoming structure.

To provide a stronger test of the existence of structural predictions in adults and children, we replicate their basic design but include an additional manipulation of the linguistic structure between verb and noun.
